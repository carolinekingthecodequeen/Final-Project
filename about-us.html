					<h4> <b>About Us</b></h4>
				</blockquote>
				<p class="quote-author"> Welcome to The Collective! We are a family oriented business that builds brand new airb&bs throughout the Nashville area. Our quality townhouses are perfect for any type of stay. Whether you are looking for a relaxing weekend getaway or for a vibrant bachelorette party, we have got you covered. All of our units are completely furnished and stocked with toiletries as well as other facilities that are needed for everyday use. Our townhouses also includes a community area that consists of seating, picnic tables, corn hole, and a ping pong table. It is a perfect spot to make friends before you hit Broadway which not to mention is only 5 minutes down the road. As of currently, The Collective operates a total of 12 new townhouses on 8th Avenue that opened up March of 2019. On top of this, The Collective is building an additional 26 units in a variety of popular parts of Nashville. In spite of COVID-19, we are currently listing only 2 townhouses due to the unavailability of other units being used for Vanderbilt patients for an indefinite period of time. To see which townhouses are currently available, go to our <a href="current-listings.html">current listing</a> page. Moreover, you will notice that each of our units have a unique name to match its bodacious theme in order to help you choose the right one for your stay. If you are wanting to book a stay, please do so through <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/.">Airbnb's website.</a> <br>
